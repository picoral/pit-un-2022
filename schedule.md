## Week 1

Training: data wrangling with prison initiative data

Monday: 9am to 11am

Topics:

* Introductions
* Git and GitHub
* Markdown (for learning diary)
* Python and R installation
* How to ask for help

Tuesday: 2pm to 4pm

Topics:

* Tidy data -- concept and discussion
* Reading data in Python and R
* Wrangling data -- filtering, mutating, pivoting

Tasks:

* Read in a different sheet from the excel file
* Play around with the data to report results (share on your GitHub repo) -- we encourage you to work with your fellow interns on this
* Fill out [pre-survey](https://uarizona.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_elhIacPHXWbKFds)
* Create learning diary entries

## Week 2

Reference materials (these will help contextualize the data modeling we will be doing this week):

* [Citations Needed Podcast, Episode 162: How the "Data-Driven" Label Sanitizes Cruel Austerity Politics](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-162-how-the-data-driven-label-sanitizes-cruel-austerity-politics)
* [ProPublica's How We Analyzed the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm)


Monday: 9am to 11am

Topics:

* Analysis Presentation
* Share repo links with Adriana
* Modeling -- what is it? 
* Demonstration in R

# Week 3

During this week you will be working with [mobility data from Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) and [from Facebook](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/covid-19) to answer the following question:

> How has COVID-19 impacted people over the past 2.5 years?

## Week 4/5

For the rest of this program, we will be implementing a computer vision solution to a research problem. 

Resources:
* [calculating the size of objects in images](https://www.uniquesoftwaredev.com/calculating-the-size-of-objects-in-photos-with-computer-vision/)

Practice classification problems:
* [Classifying blood cell types](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/blood-cells)
* [Classifying crops](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aman2000jaiswal/agriculture-crop-images)

You can find some of the data we will be working on at this [Rock pool water repo](https://github.com/cct-datascience/Rock-Pool-Data). A quick exploratory analysis of the data, not including the original images) will reveal that date and water levels correlate. In that sense, the classification could rely only on date. But we do want to use the images. Here are some questions for reflection:

* How would you approach the problem? What steps are needed to solve this?
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
