# How to Ask For Help

A key skill that you should develop as a data science is the ability to find solutions to problems. Knowing how to get help is part of that skill.

## Before You ask for help

* Check for typos. One of the most common causes of errors are typos, which in R, for example, usually throw an error such as *Error in _____ : could not find function "_____"*

* Check loaded packages. You also get errors like *Error in data %>% summary(): could not find function "%>%"* when you failed to load or import a package or library.

* Read the error message. Don’t ignore what your parser is telling you. Be aware that text that appears in your console or terminal is not always indication of errors. Sometimes it’s just a warning.

* Google is your friend. Copy and paste the exact error message on a Google search. (this step also includes read the documentation on the package you're trying to use).

* If you are still stuck, you an always try [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/). Describe the problem aloud, explaining it line-by-line, to a rubber duck or another person (who might not have any experience with programming of data science). This is also a good preparation step to asking other people for help (next section).

## Ask other people for help

Like mentioned before, you should ask your peers for help before you ask your mentor. Relying on a single person to solve all of your problems is dangerous, because that person won't be available throughout your career as a data scientist. You can use slack for Q&A.

**Be precise and informative**. The more context you can provide about what you're trying to do and what errors you're getting, the better. Also describe the steps you took to try to solve the problem yourself (from previous session).
